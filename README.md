# Guess the Word - Python Game ðŸŽ®

## Description
**Guess the Word** is a fun word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word, one letter at a time. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses while tracking the number of attempts left.

## Features ðŸš€
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Allows the player to guess one letter at a time.
- Updates the word display dynamically, revealing correctly guessed letters.
- Tracks the number of incorrect guesses (maximum of 10).
- Prevents duplicate guesses and enforces valid input.
- Displays a congratulatory message if the player wins and a loss message if they run out of attempts.

## How to Play ðŸŽ¯
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter one lowercase letter at a time as your guess.
3. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
4. If the letter is not in the word, the incorrect guess count decreases.
5. The game ends when:
   - The player correctly guesses all letters (ðŸŽ‰ You win!).
   - The player runs out of guesses (ðŸ˜ž You lose.).
